# BUG DOCUMENTATION

A running list of known issues and bugs caught by real users of this website.

---

## 🎨 Frontend Issues
- [ ] Weird UI behavior on homepage
- [ ] Resume section layout or loading bug
- [ ] The UI layout in the work Experience sections looks very crunched, and hard to read in mobile phones, it should be adjusted to fit the monitors. (probably take out the line on the left side of the bullet points)

## 🛠️ Backend Issues
- [ ] "Failed to fetch" error when computer users submits a form  (error message: Access to fetch at 'https://api.kelvinihezue.com/api/contact' from origin 'https://www.kelvinihezue.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.)

- [ ] "Load failed" error when user submits from mobile phones.

## 🧪 Suggestions / Future Improvements
- [ ] Improve error handling for bad user inputs
- [ ] Add loading indicators for slow API responses
- [ ] Add a "Submit Feedback" button for real users to report bugs. The button should open up two things:
    1. 3 options in a dropdown menu -> Report a bug 🐞, Suggest a Feature 💡, General Feedback/Comments 💡
    2. A note/Message entry box to type their report/feaure/comments.

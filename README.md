<!-- ## 🧪 Suggestions / Future Improvements
- [ ] Improve error handling for bad user inputs
- [ ] Add loading indicators for slow API responses
- [ ] Add a "Submit Feedback" button for real users to report bugs. The button should open up two things:
    1. 3 options in a dropdown menu -> Report a bug 🐞, Suggest a Feature 💡, General Feedback/Comments 💡
    2. A note/Message entry box to type their report/feaure/comments. -->
